## Description
Various tweaks for Krita's interface. 

Krita is a free and open source digital painting program. More info here: [https://krita.org](https://krita.org)

> This is a collection of features from my Krita setup that may be useful to others.
> I use Krita on Linux.
> I cannot vouch if these will work on other systems, but most likely they will. 

All items below are enabled by default but can be disabled in the plugin options

- *Split Panes*: create split tabbed panes and arrange documents side by side
- *Toolbar Icons*: highlight the active tool in the toolbars (not just the toolbox docker)
- *Shared Tool*: keep the same tool when switching documents
- *Toggle Docking*: enable or disable docking when dragging floating dockers to dockable regions
- *Save and Restore Layouts*: Menu options and shortcuts to save and restore split pane layouts as JSON files. Config option to restart Krita with your previously opened splits panes. 
- *Tab Options*: Configure the tab appearance (height, max chars, etc) and tab dragging behaviour in the options menu.

Instead of holding ctrl while dragging dockers, you can set a shortcut to toggle docking:

You can now use the left mouse button to drag tabs. Thanks to [@10zindraws](https://github.com/10zindraws)
