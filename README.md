- *Split Panes*: create split tabbed panes and arrange documents side by side
- *Toolbar Icons*: highlight the active tool in the toolbars (not just the toolbox docker)
- *Shared Tool*: keep the same tool when switching documents
- *Toggle Docking*: enable or disable docking when dragging floating dockers to dockable regions
