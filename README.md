# Krita UI Tweaks
Various tweaks for Krita's interface. 

> This is a collection of features from my Krita setup that may be useful to other.
> I use Krita on Linux.
> I cannot vouch if these will work on other systems, but most likely they will. 

All items below are enabled by default but can be disabled in the plugin options

- *Split Panes*: create split tabbed panes and arrange documents side by side
- *Toolbar Icons*: highlight the active tool in the toolbars (not just the toolbox docker)
- *Shared Tool*: keep the same tool when switching documents
- *Toggle Docking*: enable or disable docking when dragging floating dockers to dockable regions
