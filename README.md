## Description
Various tweaks for Krita's interface. 

Krita is a free and open source digital painting program. More info here: [https://krita.org](https://krita.org)

Plugin features:

- *Split Panes*: create split tabbed panes and arrange documents side by side
- *Toolbar Icons*: highlight the active tool in the toolbars (not just the toolbox docker)
- *Shared Tool*: keep the same tool when switching documents
- *Toggle Docking*: enable or disable docking when dragging floating dockers to dockable regions
- *Save and Restore Layouts*: Menu options and shortcuts to save and restore split pane layouts as JSON files. Config option to restart Krita with your previously opened splits panes. 
- *Tab Options*: Configure the tab appearance (height, max chars, etc) and tab dragging behaviour in the options menu.  
- *Layout locking*:
  You can now lock a layout (see preview below). This is helpful when you want to move images around but keep the same layout.

  
  - When layout's are locked you cannot add or remove split panes.
  - You can drag tabs from one split to another.
  - Closing tabs does not close the split pane.
  - Closing the very last document will take you back to the home screen.
  - There is a menu option and a shortcut to toggle locking.
  - Some other menu options will become disabled when locked.
- *Custom colors*: You can set your own custom background colors
